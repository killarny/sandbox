# sandbox
This is an effort to learn how to make a game, by creating a simple sandbox. I haven't yet decided exactly what sort of game it'll be, so that will take shape organically as I code it.

### setup
I highly recommand you use [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/) for this. If you don't know what that is, or why you should use it, read up on it at the [virtualenv site](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/). Either way, I'll assume you've already activated your virtualenv, or decided not to use it.

*Note: I use and recommend [virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) as well.*

#### clone repo
Clone this repo into your environment:

```

#### install requirements
There are a number of required packages to install, so you'll need to do that.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
